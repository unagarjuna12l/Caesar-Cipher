# Caesar-Cipher
Project Overview:-
The Caesar Cipher project is a Python implementation of one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. It allows users to encode and decode messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified number of positions. This project is an excellent introduction to cryptography and string manipulation in Python.

Features:-
Encryption: Encode a plaintext message by shifting letters forward.
Decryption: Decode a ciphertext by shifting letters backward.
Custom Shift Value: Users can specify the number of positions to shift.
Supports Both Uppercase and Lowercase Letters: Retains case sensitivity.
Error Handling: Ensures the shift value and input text are valid.
